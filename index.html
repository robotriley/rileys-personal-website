        <h3><em>It's me, Riley Soloner!</em></h3>
        <p>I am a software engineer in training, studying at Flatiron School in NYC.</p>
        <p>My goal is to become a skilled and persistent problem solver in tech,
            so that I may support and live out my fanciful artistic dreams:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Pay off the loan I borrowed to learn Software Engineering.</li>
            <li>Save up some money to buy a beautiful loaf of bread.</li>
            <li>Create my peculiar art projects for my adoring fans.</li>
            <li>Live generously and creatively.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>My artistic calling requires a new level of discipline and long-term strategy to keep my flame ignited.
            I'm excited to learn what I can create once I'm able to combine my old and new skillsets.</p>
